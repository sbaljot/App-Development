This project is named as REMENT which stands for REMinder NETworking.
As of now, you can set in the reminder and the app will send you the notification.
It's a very complex project, it's just a part of it.

Platforms used:
Python and Kivymd

Only these 2 platforms have been used to create this app that is why it lacks many features but works just fine to remind you.
